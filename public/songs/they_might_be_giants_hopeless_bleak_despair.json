You'll have to figure it out for yourself, but this might help: The song's exotic chords, written out for you directly above this paragraph, are a big hint-- don't be afraid to go up the neck for a few barre chords. First position chords will work pretty well too, in most cases, but I don't think JF (or Dan?) is playing very many of those-- at least not for the first verse on the Mink Car version, although in one concert clip I can see Dan playing first position chords on the first verse. Two notes on chord substitutions: *The Amaj9/C# seems to be what's played, but good ol' C#m works very well in its place; ** The F#maj7/A# was from the concert version I referred to above, but the record seems to be just an F#maj. Yeah, I've combined the two versions a bit. So sue me."
